I am currently a Master student (since fall, 2021) and an incoming Ph.D student in [School of Informatics, Xiamen University](https://informatics.xmu.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Shihui Guo](https://www.humanplus.xyz/). My research focuses on natural human-computer interaction, flexible wearables, and multimodal sensing.
